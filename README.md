## 🧰 What I Work With  

### Backend • Web • APIs  
- **Python** — Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask  
- Building REST APIs, microservices, authentication, distributed systems  

### Databases & Data  
- **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **SQLite**, **SQLAlchemy**  
- ORM-optimised schemas, migrations, performance tuning  

### AI / ML / GenAI / Agents  
- Large Language Models (LLMs), embedding & RAG pipelines  
- Agentic AI / AI Agents / multi-agent architectures  
- Data Science, Data Visualization, NLP & ML workflows  

### Tools & DevOps  
- Docker, Git, Linux, CI/CD, Redis, Celery, background-jobs, API integrations
